# Rocky Flats Collection
## Description
The Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant, about 15 miles northwest of Denver, Colorado, manufactured trigger mechanisms for nuclear weapons from various radioactive and hazardous materials from 1952 to 1989. After investigations in the late 1980s by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Environmental Protection Agency, the plant was closed and declared a Superfund cleanup site due to environmental and safety concerns. Decontamination and decommissioning began in 1992. This collection contains occurrence reports which record unusual events at the plant such as safety issues, equipment abnormalities, and incidents where employees were injured or potentially exposed to toxins. Most of the occurrence reports, which are drawn from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment Reading Room Collection, are faxed copies and are not originals.
